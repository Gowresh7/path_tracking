## Controllers Background

### Pure Pursuit Controller 

The Pure Pursuit algorithm is a popular path-tracking method for vehicles with Ackermann steering (like cars). It is designed to steer the vehicle towards a target point, known as the lookahead point, on a given path. The algorithm calculates the curvature of this arc to determine the appropriate steering angle using the following equation:-

Where:
    Î´ is the steering angle of the vehicle.
    L is the wheelbase of the vehicle (the distance between the front and rear axles).
    y is the lateral offset of the lookahead point in the vehicle's coordinate frame.
    d is the distance between the vehicle and the lookahead point.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The path tracking system is built around three main components:
